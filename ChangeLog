    LP#1900184 Patron password use phone not working
    
    An early return statement in extract_hold_notify() was removed
    in 7e92293 and added back in ddf5b4b3, so props set at the end
    of that function used in future comparisons never get set.
    
    This re-removes the return statement and sets the local notify
    variable to default string values so the rest of the function
    can play out.
    
    To test:
    1. Set org unit setting: "Patron: password from phone #" to TRUE
       at the top context location
    2. Circulation->Register Patron
    3. Type 123-456-7890 into the Daytime Phone field and press tab
    4. Note: the password field isn't updated to the last 4 digits
    5. Apply patch and repeat steps

    LP#1508208: Only look at holds that age protection allows
    
    When hold capture is attempted, we look at (currently) the first 100
    holds ordered by Best Hold Sort Selection Order.  If a very long list
    of holds are targetting an age-protected item then op capture may not
    have a chance to see a viable hold for that copy.
    
    This commit attempts to take into account the age protection currently
    set for the copy by restricting the holds to just those where the
    hold-copy-map proximity is less than or equal to the maximum proximity
    allowed by the age protection.  This works now because we store the
    hold proximity in the hold copy map, where we did not before.
    
    Being based on the hold-copy-map proximity, which is calculated
    proximity, means this is an approximation and the final hold capture
    logic may still reject some holds for the copy.  Likewise, this does
    not entirely eliminate the possibility that there may be a better hold
    to capture the copy for if the in-range set of holds is very, very
    long, but this should allow hold capture to proceed if even
    imperfectly.
    
    If no age protection is set for the copy, the current behavior
    (looking at all holds) is maintained.

    Unique indexes on nullable columns will allow multiple conceptually

    not equal itself.  This commit uses COALESCE to make sure that the
    nullable email column in the reporter.schedule table gets a value of the

    now also takes this into account and ignores the email column.

    When re-running recurring reports that are interrupted,
    it's possible to end up with a duplicate copy of the next
    recurrance of that report. This branch adds a unique index
    to reporter.schedule and tells clark-kent.pl not to worry
    about it.
    
    For the purposes of this change a duplicate report is
    one where report.schedule has identical values for report,
    (output) folder, runner, run_time, and email.

    LP#1776954 Avoid empty string for tcn_source
    
    The tcn_source for some records is an empty string, instead of the database
    default of 'AUTOGEN', because the Perl record import code avoids a Perl warning
    in the logger info call by setting the value to an empty string if it can't
    find any other source (e.g. OCLC number). Unfortunately, the empty string then
    gets passed to the database, meaning that it satisfies the non-NULL constraint
    and does not invoke the default value of 'AUTOGEN'.
    
    The resulting MARCXML then contains an empty, self-closing 901 $b subfield
    (<subfield code="b"/>) that causes an error for some other applications, such
    as Zotero, which do not anticipate empty subfields.
    
    The simple fix applied here is to follow the example for $source and $tcn of
    not setting the value of the tcn_source field in the bib record object if the
    corresponding variable evaluates to false (such as if it's an empty string).
    
    To test: create a basic record in the MARC editor that includes minimal fields
    (for example, a 100 and 245) so that it has no TCN source to extract. Check the
    MARCXML served up by SuperCat ("curl
    http://<hostname>/opac/extras/supercat/retrieve/marcxml-uris/record/<bib-id>").
    Before this patch, it will have a self-closing 901 $b subfield. After applying
    this patch and creating a new test record, the new test record will have a
    901$b subfield with the value 'AUTOGEN'.
    
    A site that has been running without this patch for a long time might want to
    check how many bib records they have with an empty tcn_source:
    
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM biblio.record_entry WHERE deleted IS FALSE AND tcn_source = '';
    
    Sites can fix the problem by issuing UPDATE statements to set the 901$b to a value
    like 'AUTOGEN' or 'Unknown'. They should probably do it per-record, however, to
    avoid locking the table in a huge commit.

    LP#1361270 Self-registration doesn't retain org unit on refresh
    
    This sets the self-registration form's org unit selector to the
    the current org unit request parameter if it's set and self-
    registration is allowed for that org unit. This will preopulate
    the org selector on refresh or error instead of resetting to the
    default context.
    
    To test:
    1. Administration->Local Administration->Library Settings Editor
       set Allow Patron Self-Registration to True (top context)
    2. go to OPAC->Request Library Card (stock link is on bottom)
    3. select a Home Library and click Submit Registration
    4. note the Home Library select doesn't retain your selection
    5. apply this fix and repeat steps
    6. note the Home Library is retained

    LP#1851413: Restore assumed order of full_path
    
    Some code, including UI rendering code in the reporting interfaces,
    assumes that the order of the full_path stored procedure will be the
    same as for the ancestors and descendants procedures, which is tree
    order from top to bottom. However, because the full_path procedure
    simply UNIONs the other two together without an explicit ORDER BY,
    that may not be -- and for org hierarchies that have been modified
    heavily, often is not -- the case in practice. This is due to
    internals of query planning in Postgres.
    
    The easiest place to see this issues is in the report interface.
    Select a template folder that is not currently shared, choose Manage
    Folder, select Share Folder, click Go, and see the dropdown of options.
    Under some circumstances, the list of org units in the dropdown there
    are incorrectly ordered (should be from top of the tree down), and some
    that should be available are disabled.
    
    This commit uses the org unit type depth to order the output as assumed.

    LP1865564 Holds grid avoid dupes (AngularJS)
    
    Address a couple if cases where the record holds grid in the AngularJS
    staff catalog would make multiple network calls to fetch holds data.
    In some cases, these calls would result displaying duplicate holds.
    
    1. Avoid fetching holds when the pickup lib selector fires its on change
    if the value provided matches the pickup lib we are already using.
    
    2. Avoid reseting and reloading the grid during an active grid load.
    Instead wait for the current load to complete before launching the next
    load action.
    
    Patch also includes a minor sanity check in the holdings code to avoid
    console errors caused during pickup lib change.

    LP#1844732 Circulation Modifier Display when Batch Editing Items
    
    Fixes the circulation modifiers multivalue list when editing items with
    more than one circulation modifier.
    
    To test in with the concerto data, go to Server Administrator ->
    Circulation Modifiers and create a couple of circ modifiers (kittens,
    puppies).
    
    Bring up the holdings view of a bib and edit a few items assigning these
    items to each of the circ modifiers.
    
    After assigning circ modifiers to several items, bring up some of these
    items into the item editor making sure that you have chosen items that
    have both circ modifiers.
    
    View the multiple values for the circ modifiers.  It will display
    something like 'No (10)'.
    
    Apply the patch. Bring up the items again and view the multiple values.
    The circ modifiers will be listed indivitually with a number
    representing the number of items with that circ modifier.
