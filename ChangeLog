    LP#1889251: make call number affix sort keys read-only
    
    This patch makes the call number prefix and suffix label sort
    key fields read-only on their respective Server Administration
    pages, as any values that a user would try to set for them
    would get overwritten by a database trigger.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Apply the patch.
    [2] Go to Server Administration -> Call Number Prefixes (or Suffixes)
        and attempt create and edit new affixes.
    [3] Verify that the label sort key is a read-only display field on the
        edit modal.

    LP#1674364 - Use database bib id for cover art lookup
    
    Export the 901c as the URN:BIBID identifier to allow the
    ATOM2XHTML.xsl to construct a cover art img link using it.
    
    Testing Notes:
    
    I used a bookbag to test this out.
    1. Create a public bookbag of items and grab the bookbag id.
    2. View the source of these links on your system to see the current output.
     /opac/extras/feed/bookbag/atom/<bookbagid>
     /opac/extras/feed/bookbag/html-full/<bookbagid>
       Make note that the jacket img link uses the ISBN to lookup cover art.
    
    Make changes.
    1. Restart supercat to re-load xsl transfor files.
      osrf_control -l --service open-ils.supercat --restart
    2. View the source and output of these links on your system to see the changes.
     /opac/extras/feed/bookbag/atom/<bookbagid>
     /opac/extras/feed/bookbag/html-full/<bookbagid>
       The cover art images should show up now in the html-full, and the
       URN:BIBID: identifier should be populated in the atom file.

    LP#1783793 - Suspend holds when activation date set in web client angularjs
    
    1. Modify Dates popup changed to not allow picking dates in the past for hold
      activation date both in the date picker, and if typed in manually.  If a
      date in the past is typed in, it is changed to today's date and an alert
      message is displayed.  The date picker just won't allow past days to be
      selected.  The alert message remains until a date in the future is selected.
    
    2. Suspend holds when the activation date is set and saved.
    
    3. Adds a note about the fact that the hold will be suspended when the hold
      activation date is selected for editing.  This makes the behavior clear so
      staff don't have to figure it out by trial and error.
    
    4. Updates several sr-only (Screen Reader Only) labels in the holds date popup
      template that were set to the wrong values.  The file was copied from the hold
      notification popup and the screen reader descriptions were left unchanged from
      those values.

    LP1842431: Remove redundant description field
    
    This branch brings about a good change, but I think having reason
    and description be identical in the case of a failure and blank /
    'SUCCESS' in the case of, well, success, is redundant and potentially
    confusing. Also, if it's not used in the default template I doubt
    anyone ever realizes it's there. :) Template editors can use
    is_renewed to decide if they want to display success as a result
    and that way the capitalization won't look like THE EIGHTIES have come
    back in fashion again. :D

    Doing this preserves the form validation that ensures that
    the user cannot submit the form with a non-numeric amount.
    
    This does lose forcing the display of default amounts such as
    "1.50" to two decimal places, but I'm figuring that form validation
    takes priority pending a longer-term solution such as a custom
    value validator or using ng-currency.

    LP1795469: Opac holdings sort now considers CN suffix
    
    To test:
    1) Create a bunch of Call Number suffixes in Administration
    -> Server Administration -> Call Number Suffixes.
    2) Go to a bib record, and add a bunch of holdings,
    all with the same call number label, owning/circ libraries,
    item numbers, and parts (if using parts) but with different
    barcodes and CN suffixes.
    3) Look at the OPAC view of these holdings.  Note that they
    are in order by barcode, without any consideration for
    the CN suffix.
    4) Apply this commit.
    5) Look at the OPAC view again.  Note that they are now sorted
    by CN suffix, and then by barcode.

    When clearing a combobox value, no combobox options are displayed in the
    dropdown.  This allows users to clear the value then tab out of the box
    without the typeahead magic forcing selection of the first entry.
    
    The full list can still be displayed by clicking on the combobox.

    View grid, take all selected grid rows into consideration when
    determining how many call numbers to add and what their owning libs
    should be.
    
    To test:
    * Navigate to the Holdings View tab of a record detail page in the Angular
      staff catalog.
    * Select multiple rows in the grid which are org unit-only rows (i.e.
      the row does not refer to a specific call number or item).
    * From the action menu / right client menu, select "Add Callnumbers"
    * Confirm that a call number entry for each selected org unit is present
      in the spawned holdings editor.

    LP1819542 Hanging transits can cause checkins to fail
    
    So two bits of defensive programming for do_checkin:
    
        sub fix_broken_transit_status
        sub cancel_transit_if_circ_exists
    
    I don't know if the first one does anything useful, but the idea is that it'll
    at least temporarily set the copy status to In Transit for any status checks
    within the do_checkin method that test for that.  It doesn't actually repair
    the status permanently (at least in the case of, say, an existing transit being
    re-used for a ROUTE_ITEM event).  We may want to do that.
    
    The second one will abort an associated transit (including retargeting a hold
    for a hold transit) if both an active transit and an active circulation exist
    for the item.  This handles the situation I've been using to test the bug:
    
        1) transit an item (CONC90000436 in Concerto)
        2) artificially change its status directly in the database (for example, to
           Available)
        3) check it out to a patron (99999376864 in Concerto), noting
           that the Cancel Transit prompt does not get triggered
        4) check in the item

    [1] From an AngularJS part of the staff interface, note that
        hitting F8 sometimes does not perform the retrieve
        last patron action, nor does F8 show up on the list of
        hot keys when you hit "?" outside of an input.

        hotkey should consistently work.

    LP1474874: Consistent page headers in the Angular client
    
    This commit ensures that each screen in the Angular staff client uses
    the <eg-staff-banner> component to better orient its users.
    
    This commit also gives the eg-staff-banner some <h1> semantics, per
    WebAIM's guidance: "Pages should be structured in a hierarchical manner,
    generally with one 1st degree headings (<h1>) being the most important
    (usually page titles or main content heading)" -- https://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/
    
    To test:
    
    1) Go to [your-server]/eg2/en-US/staff/catalog/search
    2) Confirm that there is a header that gives the page title at the top
    of the page.
    3) Go to an Angular Vandelay page.
    4) Confirm that you see a similar header as in step 2.
    5) Go to an Angular Administration page.
    6) repeat step 4.

    LP#1754387 - User Buckets - Pending Users Enhancement
    
    It wasn't possible to load more than 100 users from a barcode file import in
    user buckets because of two issues.  The pager was limited to only showing 100
    barcodes at a time, and moving any users from the pending list would clear the
    pending list.
    
    Here is a branch that makes the following changes.
    
    1. Sets the default number of items to 100 and allows choosing the
      500,1000,10000 options for the pager.
    
    2. When moving users from pending to a bucket, only removes the moved users
      from the pending list.  This allows the user to move a larger number of
      users to a bucket from pending, a batch at a time.
    
    Testing Plan:
    
    Before Changes:
    
    1. Load a file with 110 patron barcodes in the User Buckets, Pending Users interface.
    2. See that the pager only allows a max of 100 for the page size.
    3. Move one user to a bucket and note that the pending list gets cleared.
    
    After Changes:
    
    1. Load a file with 110 patron barcodes.
    2. See that the pager allows for picking larger page sizes.
    3. Move one user to a bucket, and note that the pending list removes just that one user.
    
    Another way to see the changes is to pick a pager size of 25, and select all the
    entries.  Then move them to a bucket and see that you can continue to move
    batches of 25 until you have moved all the pending users.

    LP1845241: Use the correct API call to Undelete a bib record
    
    To test:
    
    1) Open up a delete-ready bibliographic record in the Web client
    (no attached holdings, no located URI, no open orders attached, etc.)
    2) Delete it.
    3) Undelete it.  Note that the "Undelete" button briefly turns into a
    "Delete" button before changing back to an "Undelete" button.  Note that
    the bib record does not show up in search results within the Web client.
    4) Apply this commit.
    5) Now try undeleting the record again.  Notice that the "Delete" button
    does not revert to an "Undelete" button.  Note also that the record is
    once again showing up in search results (although you may have to be a
    bit creative using search terms, due to search results caching).

    LP1805860: Display long patron names without obscuring input fields
    
    Long patron names can obscure the input fields and menu items on patron
    action screens. The only workaround is to reduce the font size using the
    browser controls until the input fields and menu items are visible.
    
    While the fixed position saves space at the top of the screen for
    typical cases, it can be hard for staff to remember the font-reduction
    workaround when they hit a long patron name.
    
    Removing the fixed position CSS also better supports the display of
    regular patron names on browsers that are not wide enough to display the
    top menu (Search/Circulation/Cataloging/.../Workstation name/Locale) all
    on a single line.

    LP#1844365: fix initialization of stat cats in patron registration form
    
    If you edit a patron and it has (or gets added) a stat cat entry,
    then from the registration form click on its inline patron search
    link, fetch a patron that has no stat cats, then edit it, the
    first patron's stat cats can show up in the registration form.
    If the second patron does have stat cats, but not values set
    for all of them, then the first patron's stat cat entries can
    fill in cases where no entry was previously set.
    
    This patch fixes patronRegSvc's initialization when loading
    an existing patron record to avoid this.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Edit a patron and ensure that it has at least one
        statistical category set.
    [2] From the patron search link in the patron app tab
        bar, NOT the Search | Patron menu item, search for
        and retrieve a patron that has no stat cats assigned.
    [3] Edit the patron. Observe that the first patron's
        stat cat entry displays in the second patron's
        registration form.
    [4] Apply the patch and repeats steps 1-3. This time,
        the previous patron's stat cats should not infect
        the second patron's registration form.

    LP1864056: Don't compare multiple new Date()s
    
    This branch addresses a race condition when
    checking out or renewing items.
    (The use of minDate in items_out was implicitly
    immune to this issue, but that is made explicit
    with this patch.)
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] The race condition would be difficult to reliably
        reproduce directly, although a tool like
        https://github.com/mattzeunert/javascript-clock-speedup
        might help simulate the problem, so to test, verify
        that the following actions do not break:
    
        * checking out a loan, both with and without
          setting a specific due date
        * renewing a loan with a specific due date
          from the patron items out tab
        * renewing a loan from Circulation -> Renew Items,
          both with and without setting a specific due date.
